  <h1>About</h1>
	<p> Six Rivers National Forest is a National Forest located in northwest 
	California. It encompasses enchanting old-growth redwood forests,

	recreational areas in the forest, for hardcore backpackers and casual 
	motorists alike. Then, take a look at recent reports about the condition of 
	places you'd like to visit, or let us know about the condition of 
	a spot you recently visited by submitting a report yourself. </p>
